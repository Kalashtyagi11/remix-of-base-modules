/**
 * BN Product Version — Publish Gate
 *
 * Single authoritative gate that MUST be called before flipping a
 * bn_product_version to ACTIVE (publish) or pushing a config change
 * that would affect a live product version.
 *
 * It composes the checks so callers don't have to remember to run them
 * individually:
 *
 *   0. Version substance — at least one active eligibility rule and one
 *      active formula binding. Blocks. (BUG-02)
 *   0b. At least one application channel enabled. Blocks. (BUG-48)
 *   1. Cross-tab conflict detection  → ERROR-level conflicts block.
 *   2. Channel readiness (staff/public) → disabled channels are OK;
 *      mis-configured enabled channels block.
 *   3. Baseline configuration validation (when the version's product
 *      maps to a known SKN baseline) → FAIL items block, WARNING does not.
 *
 * Returns a structured report. `ok=false` means publish MUST be refused;
 * callers should surface `errors` to the user verbatim and offer a link
 * back to the relevant Product Catalog tab.

/**
 * BUG-02 — a version must actually contain something before it can go live.
 *
 * Publishing a version with every eligibility rule deleted used to succeed.
 * The legal/coverage gate inspects each rule in turn, so with no rules it found
 * no problems and reported success; nothing else required rules to exist. The
 * baseline check would have caught it, but runs only for products whose code
 * matches a built-in SKN baseline — so for any product created in the
 * application it never ran at all. Deleting all the rules was therefore the
 * easiest way to get past the publish checks, which is exactly backwards.
 *
 * A version with no eligibility rules passes every claim without a single
 * check. A version with no formula binding cannot calculate an amount at all —
 * the Calculation screen already warns that every calculation will fail, so
 * publishing in that state must not be allowed either.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT wrapped in a try/catch that downgrades to a warning, as the
 * checks above are. If we cannot count the rules we cannot claim the version is
 * safe, and a gate that passes when it fails to run is not a gate.
