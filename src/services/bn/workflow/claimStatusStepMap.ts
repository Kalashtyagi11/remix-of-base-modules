/**
 * Claim status → workflow step.
 *
 * Routing resolves the workbasket from the workflow step that owns the claim
 * right now. Status names and step names are two different vocabularies —
 * only EVIDENCE_REVIEW, CALCULATION and DECISION are spelled identically — so
 * matching them by name would silently unroute most claims. The mapping is
 * therefore stated explicitly here.
 *
 * `INTAKE` is included deliberately: `bn_submit_claim_application` currently
 * inserts that status even though no transition rule references it. Any claim
 * created since must still route, and the backfill must not skip them.
 *
 * A status that maps to nothing is NOT an error. It means "no step owns this
 * claim" — the claim keeps its current basket and the reason is recorded. It is
 * never dropped out of every queue.
