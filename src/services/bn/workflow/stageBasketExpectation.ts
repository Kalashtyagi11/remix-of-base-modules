/**
 * Which workbaskets a workflow stage is expected to be served by.
 *
 * Two separate defects made this necessary:
 *
 *  1. `BN_PAYMENT_OFFICER` staffs both `BN_PAYMENT_PREPARATION` and
 *     `BN_PAYMENT_ISSUE`. Resolving a stage by role alone was therefore
 *     ambiguous, and the tie was broken alphabetically — a claim landed in
 *     Payment Issue because "I" sorts before "P", not because anyone chose it.
 *  2. A template step can name a stage code that contradicts the basket it
 *     points at (the Assistance Pension template bound its "Payment
 *     Authorization" step to the AWARD_SETUP stage and to the Payment
 *     Preparation basket). Nothing detected that, so an award-setup claim sat
 *     in a payment queue with no warning.
 *
 * This module states the expectation once so the resolver can disambiguate and
 * the queue-health reconciliation can report disagreements using exactly the
 * same rule.
